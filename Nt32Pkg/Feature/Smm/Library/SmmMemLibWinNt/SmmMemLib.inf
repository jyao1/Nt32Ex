#  Instance of SMM memory check library.
#
#  SMM memory check library library implementation. This library consumes SMM_ACCESS2_PROTOCOL
#  to get SMRAM information. In order to use this library instance, the platform should produce
#  all SMRAM range via SMM_ACCESS2_PROTOCOL, including the range for firmware (like SMM Core
#  and SMM driver) and/or specific dedicated hardware.
